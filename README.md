# Carousel Web Component
#### **A tiny(1.2Kb), framework agnostic, light weight, zero dependancy, touch friendly carousel component**

## Why?
Most of the carousel components out there do not leverage latest css and javascript features like css scroll snap, flex order and webcomponents etc. Using these features makes carousel much more eligent, reliable, light weight and framework agnostic

## Disclaimers
- This is still a WIP. Feel free to contribute.

- This is a webcomponent make sure you are not running on old browsers (by that I mostly mean Internet exploer). If you want to use it in old browser that do not support webcomponents please include [webcomponent polyfill from here](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills)

- This package is ideal and best suitable for static sites. The support for dynamic content on carousel is in roadmap
